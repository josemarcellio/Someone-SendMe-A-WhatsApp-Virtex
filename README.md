# WhatsApp Virtex (Maybe)
This might be a virtex (virus text) that causes WhatsApp to crash and become inaccessible, requiring a data reset to log back in. I am not sure if it works or not, but someone sent me a virtex in the form of a chat, and their username was changed to symbols or unique characters. It seems that because I am using an iPhone with the latest iOS, this virtex does not work. I think it might work on older iOS versions or only on Android.

##### I don't know why this monkey sent me this picture, but it seems like it was blocked by WhatsApp, haha!

## Disclaimer
I don't know how to use this, but I'm logging all the conversations. I think you just need to send the method I've uploaded, then copy it and send it to someone on WhatsApp
